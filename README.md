# java-multithreading
1.)Construct a java program to generate 500 random non-prime integers 
and store then in an array. While storing them into an array if you 
identify any prime number then throw an user defined exception named 
as “PrimeNumberIsGenerated”. The recommended way to handle this 
exception is, increment the generated prime number by 2 and store it in 
current location of the array. At the end of the program display the 
elements of the array along with the index positions where exception is 
raised.

2.)Can we achieve multiple inheritance in java? Justify your answer with an 
appropriate programming example.

3.)Linear Search using multi threading.

4.)Count occurences of an integer using multi threading.
